# Distributed Lock
# Implementing a distributed lock can be done using external services like Redis. Here's an example using redis-py and redlock-py.
#
# Requires installation of redis and redlock-py
# $> pip install redis redlock-py


import redis
from redlock import Redlock

# Set up the Redis client and Redlock
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
redlock = Redlock([redis_client])

# Acquire a distributed lock
lock = redlock.lock("distributed_lock_key", 1000)

if lock:
    try:
        print("Distributed Lock: Acquired lock")
        # Critical section code
    finally:
        redlock.unlock(lock)
else:
    print("Distributed Lock: Failed to acquire lock")
